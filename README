Specialized desk for precision electronics and micro-mechanical work. Large, 8' x 3' work surface, equipment shelf, and storage shelf. Drawers and sliding trays are also supported.

_Construction_
Equipment shelf height should provide adequate clearance for a large widescreen computer monitor, while being low enough to support several feet of equipment within reach while sitting. Ideally, soldering irons, oscilloscopes, power supplies, and similar equipment are all kept on the equipment shelf, leaving the work surface absolutely clean at all times. By default, 19" clearance is provided, fine adjustment is left to the user.

Bright lighting is essential for precision work. At least twelve ~40W (~2400 lumen) daylight compact flourescent light bulbs are recommended.

Consider ading reinforcement 2x4 segments between the worksufrace and floor, as shown in the photo. Also be sure to use plenty of wood glue and appropriately sized, well placed, coated deck screws. Order of operations is also important - some segments may need to be joined interally.

_Equipment_
Following equipment is recommended.

Microscope - AmScope SM-1BS, SM-1BN, SE304-PX, or SE104-P. Strongly recommend SM-1BS or SM-1BN. Be sure to mount protective glass over any microscope objectives while soldering to prevent damage.

Calipers - http://www.harborfreight.com/6-in-digital-caliper-with-sae-and-metric-fractional-readings-68304.html

Oscilloscope - Isolated (ie. battery powered) digital scopes with Vmax, Vavg, Vmin, Vrms, and frequency statistics preferred. DSO Nano recommended. - http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/DSO-Nano-v3-p-1358.html
Bench Scope - Occasionally more channels and bandwidth is helpful, particularly if an envelope detector is not readily available. Consider an analog XY capable scope to go with the digital scope.
Function Generator - Should be capable of sine, triangle, and square waveform output at >1MHz.

Tweezers - EROP7SA available from mouser.

Soldering Iron - WSM1/TWSM1/WSM1C, WD1000M, WX1011 (must use WMRP/WXMP soldering pencil) - http://www.amazon.com/Weller-WSM1-Compact-Digital-Soldering/dp/B00466IF60
